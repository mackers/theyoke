TheYoke is an ultra-simple, polite RSS aggregrator designed for use on the UNIX command line.

Features:

    * Easy CLI execution.
    * Written in PERL, so cross platform.
    * Easy setup - single executable.
    * Robust XML::RSS parser.
    * Simple configuration file(s) - a list of URLs.
    * Shows only the latest headlines.
    * Polite to web servers - utilises "Last-modified" and "ETag" headers.
    * Customizable output - title/description/url.
    * Command line options to specify more or less feeds or filter by regex.
    * Can be used to feed urls to wget or youtube-dl.
    * Free to download and use.
